# Complete the method called palindrome? which should accept a string as a parameter and return a boolean indicated whether the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same both forwards and backwards. Examples: eye, madam, racecar

  # else # If string is not the same when reversed
  #   puts "#{ string } is not a palindrome."
